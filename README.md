# nodegit-archive
Support for git archive streaming using nodegit

A very bare-bones gitArchive library built on top of nodegit.
A fun weekend project which might be a bit more fleshed out in the future.

It's already functional (check out `nodegit-archive-cli.js` for an example usage (the two lines at the bottom are the important ones).
There are also a lot of hard-coded properties (commit-ish to archive, archive format, etc), which will be extracted and configurable in the future.
